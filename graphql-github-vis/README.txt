IMPORTANT! Data fetching scripts require environment variable GITHUB_API_TOKEN containing GitHub OAuth token.


index.html
	A simple webpage for testing data visualization using D3 and Javascript.


./css
	CSS for the webpage.


./d3-tip
	Additional script required for tool tip style labels on D3 graphs.


./github-data
	Where all data used for visualizations, generated by data fetching scripts, is stored.
	These data files are intended to be read by the webpage's js scripts each time it is loaded, and should require little additional manipulation.
	Also includes scripts for viewing data in human-readable format.


./inputs
	Simple text files containing input lists, e.g. list of organizations, list of independent repositories.


./js
	Javascripts for the webpage.


./queries
	The actual queries sent to GitHub's GraphQL API when data fetching scripts are run.


./scripts
	Scripts for data fetching and manipulation. Data is written to ./github-data in appropriate json formats.

	New files are created for each type of data structure. For most files, a new entry is added to the file for each day that the scripts are run. If a script is run multiple times in a single day, the data for that day will be overwritten. Other files contain only one entry with the most recent data.

	Running MASTER.sh will run all of the necessary scripts in the appropriate order to fetch updated data and perform any additional manipulation. It will also update LAST_MASTER_UPDATE.txt to record when the MASTER script was last run.
