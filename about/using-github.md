### Introduction

If you're new to GitHub and open source in general, figuring out how to get set up can be a challenge. This guide is for getting started with GitHub, and specifically targets LLNL developers working in the [LLNL GitHub organization](https://github.com/LLNL).

### Setting up your GitHub Account

If you're new to GitHub, you may want to read through the GitHub Help pages on [Setting up and managing your GitHub profile](https://help.github.com/categories/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/). Here are some of the highlights:

1. [Create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/join)

  - You *do not need* a separate work account and personal account, unless you prefer to.

2. [Update your profile information](https://github.com/settings/profile)

  - **Photo**: A headshot photo, or image that is uniquely you.
  - **Name**: Your first and last name.
  - **Bio**: Include a few words about yourself! Don't forget to mention @LLNL.
  - **URL**: This might be your https://people.llnl.gov page, or a personal website if you prefer.
  - **Company**: Probably `Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, @LLNL`.
  - **Location**: Your primary location.

3. Add your `@LLNL` email address (and any aliases) to your [Email Settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) page.

  - This will link any commits done via [your Git identity](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#Your-Identity) to your GitHub account.

4. [Enable Two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security)

  - *This will soon be a requirement for membership in the @LLNL GitHub organization.*
  - For more information, check out the [Two-factor Authentication](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication) post on the GitHub Blog.


### Joining the Organization

If you are an employee at LLNL, and have 2FA enabled, congratulations, you are eligible to join the LLNL GitHub organization!

1. Send an email, with your GitHub username included, to [github-admin@llnl.gov](mailto:github-admin@llnl.gov) from your `@llnl.gov` email, requesting to be added to the organization.

2. After an administrator has added you to the organization, you will receive a notification email from GitHub.

  - Alternatively, once the invitation has been sent, you will see a notification banner at the top of https://github.com/llnl which you can use to accept the invitation.

3. Head over to the [@LLNL People](https://github.com/orgs/LLNL/people) page make your membership `Public`.

4. Welcome to the organization!
