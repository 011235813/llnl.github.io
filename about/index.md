Welcome to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory software portal! The purpose of this software portal is to serve as a hub for open source software that is produced by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

LLNL produces software on a daily basis. Some of this software is used only internally, other components are licensed for use by external partners and collaborators, still other software is released, or even actively developed, in the open on software hosting platforms such as GitHub.com, Bitbucket.org, Sourceforge.net, and others.

### Private Repositories

The LLNL GitHub Organization has a limited number (currently 10) of private repositories available for LLNL Employees to host software not ready or not applicable for unlimited public release. In general, we would like to encourage that all open source work be done completely in the open, but we want to be able to provide the flexibility to have some privacy available, e.g. for industrial partnerships, university collaborations leading up to a publication, etc.

Remember that these repositories are *still hosted* on GitHub servers, and content placed in them should be limited to "email like" communications. That means:

* NO Classified
* NO Export Controlled
* NO Official Use Only (OUO)
* NO NDA or vendor-proprietary information
* NO Unclassified Controlled Information (UCI)
* NO Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI)

When in doubt, contact a Derivative Classifier (DC) and / or Information Management (IM) for further guidance.

### Contact

If you have any questions or would like to request a private repository, please don't hesitate to contact [Ian Lee](mailto:ian@llnl.gov) or one of [the GitHub organization admins](mailto:github-admin@llnl.gov).
