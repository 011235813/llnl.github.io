## {{ page.title }}
{: .page-header}

Welcome to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory software portal! The
purpose of this software portal (or catalog if you prefer) is to serve as the
definitive source of truth pointing to all software that has been produced and
released by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

LLNL produces software on a daily basis. Some of this software is used only
internally, other components are licensed for use by external partners and
collaborators, still other software is released, or even actively developed, in
the open on software hosting platforms such as GitHub.com, Bitbucket.org,
Sourceforge.net, and others.

This page is designed to be a single stop to find all types of software
produced and available due to the expertise of Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory scientists and engineers.

### Private Repositories

The LLNL GitHub Organization has a limited number (currently 10) of private
repositories available for LLNL Employees to host software not ready or not
applicable for unlimited public release. In general, we would like to encourage
that all open source work be done completely in the open, but we want to be
able to provide the flexibility to have some privacy available, e.g. for
industrial partnerships, university collaborations leading up to a publication,
etc.

Remember that these repositories are *still hosted* on GitHub servers, and
content placed in them should be limited to "email like" communications. That
means:

* NO Classified
* NO Official Use Only (OUO)
* NO Export Controlled
* NO Unclassified Controlled Information (UCI)
* NO Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI)

When in doubt, contact a Derivative Classifer (DC) and / or Information
Management (IM) for further guidance.

### Contact

If you have any questions or would like to request a private repository, please
don't hesitate to contact [Ian Lee](mailto:ian@llnl.gov) or one of the other
organizational owners.
