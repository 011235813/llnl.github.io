# Project Logos

The home and /radiuss pages display a logo next to each repo when they appear under the topic categories. This feature does not apply to the /catalog view.

If a repo has its own logo, that should display. If not, then its organization's avatar should display. Every repo should have one logo or avatar; no repo should be "empty."

Logo files should be uploaded to a specific protected OneDrive folder called [Repo logos (all) - standard file names](https://doellnl-my.sharepoint.com/personal/auten1_llnl_gov/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fauten1%5Fllnl%5Fgov%2FDocuments%2FOS%20portal%20%28software%2Ellnl%2Egov%29%20design%20mockups%2FRepo%20logos%20%28all%29%20%2D%20standard%20file%20names).
- Each file should contain the repo name plus `repo-logo` separated by hyphens (e.g., `MFEM-repo-logo`).
- Files should be .jpg, .gif, or .png.
- Contact @hauten if you are unable to access.
