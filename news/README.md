# News Posts 

News posts appear on the [News](https://software.llnl.gov/news/) and [Archive](https://software.llnl.gov/news/archive/) pages in reverse chronological order (i.e., newest first). The list is curated to promote LLNL's open source endeavors and community engagement. Posts may be tagged with the following topics, which are not associated with the [category tags](https://github.com/LLNL/llnl.github.io/tree/master/category) applied to repos:

- `event` - announcement of an upcoming event/conference
- `multimedia` - synopsis of a video or podcast published on another platform (e.g., YouTube)
- `new-release` - announcement of substantial software release (i.e., more than bug fixes)
- `new-repo` - announcement of new repo added to LLNL's software catalog
- `profile` - profile of a developer
- `story` - synopsis of a relevant news or research-focused article
- `this-website` - announcement of feature enhancement or other changes to this site
- `trip-report` - recap of an event/conference

Tags should appear in each post's front matter under the title and separated by commas:

`---`
`title: "Title of Post"`
`tags: new-repo`
`---``
