[DFTT](https://github.com/LLNL/DFTT) (Detection Framework Testbed and Toolkit) is a database and associated Java programs intended to facilitate the development and testing of algorithms for operating suites of correlation and subspace detectors. This framework is a generalization of the system described in Harris and Dodge ([2011](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/101/2/763/349584/An-Autonomous-System-for-Grouping-Events-in-a)). It allows retrospective processing of sequences of data using various system configurations. Results are saved in a database, so it is easy to compare the results obtained using different configurations of the system.
