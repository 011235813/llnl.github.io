Conduit provides an intuitive model for describing hierarchical scientific data in C++, C, Fortran, and Python. It is used for data coupling between packages in-core, serialization, and I/O tasks. The Core API provides a flexible way to describe and access hierarchical data. v0.5 includes:
- node set support for Python tuples and Numpy String Arrays
- new blueprints for topological data generation and ZFP compressed array data
- new relays to support ZFP and HPF5 I/O
