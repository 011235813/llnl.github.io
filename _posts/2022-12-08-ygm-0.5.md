[YGM](https://github.com/LLNL/ygm) is a general-purpose, pseudo-asynchronous communication library built on top of MPI in C++. The repo's utility is provided through its mailbox abstractions, which are used for point-to-point and broadcast communications. Release v0.5 includes a parser for Parquet files, improved broadcasts, and new containers.
