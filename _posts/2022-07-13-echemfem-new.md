[EchemFEM](https://github.com/LLNL/echemfem) provides finite element solvers for electrochemical transport. Both continuous Galerkin (CG) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes are provided. The following transport mechanisms are available: diffusion, advection, electromigration. EchemFEM supports both non-porous and porous cases. The ionic potential can either be described using an electroneutrality constraint or a Poisson equation. In the porous case, the electronic potential can be described by a Poisson equation.
