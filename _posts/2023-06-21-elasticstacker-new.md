[Elastic Stacker](https://github.com/LLNL/elastic-stacker) is used to export configuration objects (dashboards, pipelines, alerts, etc.) out of one Elastic Stack and then allow importing into another Stack. A main use case is for moving from development done in a PRE environment, and into a PROD environment. Another use case is for keeping configurations in sync between multiple production stacks, but that might live on separate networks.
