[Spack](https://spack.io/) has already been removing the ugly work from building HPC codes, but with the announcement of the Spack Binary Cache&mdash;which is [hosted on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/hpc/introducing-the-spack-rolling-binary-cache/)&mdash;build and deploy times for these complicated applications will drop by 95% or more in most cases. Spack core developer Greg Becker spoke with [HPC Tech Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/c/HPCTechShorts) to explain how it works and discuss what's behind it. The video ["Get your HPC codes installed and running in minutes using Spack's Binary Cache"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CilsaBBycZY) runs 15:11.
