Computer scientist Vanessa Sochat [talked to BSSw](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/surveys-to-understand-developer-health-and-happiness) about an effort to survey software developer needs at LLNL. She discusses how developer needs can be grouped into two categories—those that are practical (e.g., tools and resources) and those that are intangible (e.g., happiness, communication, or motivation)—as well as the survey methodology and some of the results, which were [published on the RADIUSS website](https://software.llnl.gov/radiuss/2023/02/08/first-developer-survey/) in February.
