[MuyGPs](https://github.com/LLNL/MuyGPyS) is a Gaussian process estimation method that affords fast hyperparameter optimization by way of performing leave-one-out cross-validation. MuyGPs achieves best-in-class speed and scalability by limiting inference to the information contained in k nearest neighborhoods for prediction locations for both hyperparameter optimization and tuning. Documentation and other resources are available at the MuyGPs [Read the Docs site](https://muygpys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
