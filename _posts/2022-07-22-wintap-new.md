[Wintap](https://github.com/LLNL/Wintap) is an extensible host-based agent for Windows. Wintap provides a singular and extensible service-based runtime environment, a unified data model, API abstraction, and data discovery for an integrated, locally hosted web-based analytic “workbench” from where real-time event streams can be queried and explored.
