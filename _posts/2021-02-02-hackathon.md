Held since 2012, LLNL's hackathons are 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually and often strive to learn new skills, programming languages, and tools in service to LLNLâ€™s missions. Like the spring and summer hackathons of 2020, this year's winter event (February 11-12) will be held virtually using WebEx and Mattermost for collaboration. With LLNL's Data Science Institute sponsoring the hackathon, the agenda will include guest speakers (below) discussing data science topics relevant to the Lab's missions. (Participants are not required to attend the talks.) [Registration {% raw %}<i class="fa fa-lock"></i>{% endraw %}](https://hackathon.llnl.gov) closes on February 8.
