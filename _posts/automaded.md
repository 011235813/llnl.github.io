title: AutomaDeD: Diagnosing Performance and Correctness Faults
---

One of our open-source performance analysis tools is AutomaDed, a tool that automatically diagnoses performance and correctness faults in MPI applications. AutomaDeD has two major functionalities: (1) identifying abnormal MPI tasks and code regions, and (2) finding the least-progressed task.

Learn more on our [Computation website](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/automaded), and check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/llnl/AutomaDeD).
