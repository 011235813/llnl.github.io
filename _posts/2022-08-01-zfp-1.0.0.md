[zfp](https://github.com/LLNL/zfp) is a library for compressed numerical arrays that support high-throughput read and write random access. zfp also supports streaming compression of integer and floating-point data, e.g., for applications that read and write large data sets to and from disk. zfp is primarily written in C and C++ but also includes Python and Fortran bindings. This major release includes numerous changes to function signatures and data structures, a more complete API for pointers and iterators, rounding modes for reducing bias in compression errors, support for pointers and iterators into array views, refactored compressed-array C++ implementation, and much more.
