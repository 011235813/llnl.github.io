Developed at LLNL, the [zfp software library](https://github.com/LLNL/zfp) provides a comprehensive solution to both lossy and lossless data compression. zfp reduces the storage space of high-precision floating-point data without sacrificing its accuracy. Unique among data compressors, zfp is designed to be a compact number format for storing data arrays in-memory in compressed form while still supporting high-speed random access. zfp divides multidimensional arrays into small blocks that are independently compressed and decompressed on demand when an array element is accessed, without the applicationâ€™s knowledge. This flexibility allows applications to work with zfp arrays as though they were regular uncompressed arrays while saving storage, time, and compute power.
