Pushing our supercomputers to their limits requires getting closer to the metal than standard software and operating systems allow. [Variorum](https://github.com/LLNL/variorum) provides robust, portable interfaces that allow us to measure and optimize computation at the physical level: temperature, cycles, energy, and power. With that foundation, we can get the best possible use of our world-class computing resourcesâ€”from purchasing to runtime systems to job scheduling. [Watch a new video about Variorum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgJGgPERBao) on YouTube (6:57).
