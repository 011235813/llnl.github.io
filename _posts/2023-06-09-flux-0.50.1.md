[Flux](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core) is a flexible framework for resource management consisting of a suite of projects, tools, and libraries which may be used to build site-custom resource managers for HPC centers. This release adds the flux-batch(1) and flux-alloc(1) `--conf` option, which makes sub-instance configuration significantly easier. Sys admins may note that *named configurations* can be added to `/etc/xdg/flux/config` for configurations that are anticipated to be commonly needed such as node-exclusive scheduling.
