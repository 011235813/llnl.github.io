[Tribol](https://github.com/LLNL/Tribol) is a modular interface physics library featuring state-of-the-art contact physics methods. High-fidelity simulations modeling complex interactions of moving bodies require specialized contact algorithms to enforce constraints between surfaces that come into contact in order to prevent penetration and to compute the associated contact response forces. Tribol aims to provide a unified interface for various contact algorithms, specifically, contact detection and enforcement, and serve as a common infrastructure enabling the research and development of advanced contact algorithms.
