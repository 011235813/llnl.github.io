[LaSDI](https://github.com/LLNL/LaSDI) (Latent Space Dynamics Identification) enables a fast and accurate solution process on various partial differential equations (i.e., Burgersâ€™ equations, radial advection problem,  nonlinear heat conduction problem), achieving more speed-ups and less relative error with respect to the corresponding full order models. The repo includes four examples: 1D Burgers, 2D Burgers, a radial advection example as from [MFEM](https://mfem.org), and a time-dependent diffusion example.

The accompanying repo [gLaSDI](https://github.com/LLNL/gLaSDI) ("greedy" LaSDI, or Parametric Physics-informed Greedy Latent Space Dynamics Identification) provides a framework for accurate, efficient, and robust data-driven reduced-order modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. gLaSDI's autoencoder discovers intrinsic nonlinear latent representations of high-dimensional data, while dynamics identification models capture local latent-space dynamics.
