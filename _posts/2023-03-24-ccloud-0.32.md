LANL led with LLNL contributors, [Charliecloud](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud) provides user-defined software stacks for HPC centers. It uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources. Version 0.32 includes updates to `ch-image`, `ch-test`, `ch-run`, and other executables.

*Please note the team's request for feedback:* We are considering removing `ch-ssh`, a utility program to facilitate SSH connections from one Charliecloud container into an equivalent container on another host. Please respond to and/or comment on our poll, especially if you use this tool, in discussion [#1600](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/discussions/1600).
