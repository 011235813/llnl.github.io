[Quandary](https://github.com/LLNL/quandary) provides optimal control for open quantum systems via an optimization solver. The underlying quantum dynamics model open quantum systems, using the Lindblad master equation to evolve a density matrix in time. With this latest release, a Python interface allows the user to use an (arbitrary) user-defined system and control Hamiltonian operators during the simulation and optimization process.
