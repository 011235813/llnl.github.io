title: ESGF: Supporting Climate Research Collaboration
---

 Understanding and predicting climate change and extreme weather events requires advanced tools to securely store, manage, access, analyze, visualize, and process enormous and distributed data sets. This “big data” challenge is being met with the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF), an LLNL-led international collaboration with the primary goal of facilitating advancements in Earth system science. Designed and maintained by dozens of research institutions, ESGF  powers most global climate change research, notably including assessments by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
