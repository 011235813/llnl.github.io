[Variorum Integrations](https://github.com/LLNL/variorum-integrations) is an extensible vendor-neutral library for Linux that exposes power and performance monitoring and control of low-level hardware dials. This repository contains [Variorum](https://github.com/llnl/variorum)-annotated codes and integrations. [Variorum docs](https://variorum.readthedocs.io/) explain how to use these integrations.
