title: GREMLINs: Emulating Exascale Conditions on Today's Platforms
---

The GREMLIN framework enhances performance modeling and evaluation by emulating the behavior of anticipated future architectures on current machines. We are experimenting with different classes of GREMLINs to reduce operating power, enable thermal throttling, limit resources in the memory hierarchy, and more.

Learn more on our [Computation website](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/gremlins), and fork the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/llnl/gremlins).
