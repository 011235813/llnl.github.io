[HiOp](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop) is an optimization solver for solving certain mathematical optimization problems expressed as nonlinear programming problems. This lightweight HPC solver leverages application's existing data parallelism to parallelize the optimization iterations by using specialized linear algebra kernels. The latest version hosts a series of comprehensive internal developments and software re-engineering to improve the portability and performance on accelerators/GPU platforms, including a new execution space abstraction to allow multiple hardware backends to run concurrently.
