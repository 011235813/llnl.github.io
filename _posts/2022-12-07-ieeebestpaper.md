The [IEEE international eScience conference](https://www.escience-conference.org/2022/), which emphasizes compute- and data-intensive research methods, bestowed the 2022 Best Paper Award on a multidisciplinary team that includes LLNL staff and external collaborators. The paper, “[Scalable Composition and Analysis Techniques for Massive Scientific Workflows](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1893596),” details the optimization of a drug screening workflow for the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA Molecule Screening (MoleS) workflow combines specialized software tools to manage HPC hardware heterogeneity. The MoleS end-to-end workflow relies on both general-purpose and domain-specific software tools, some of which are open source and/or developed at LLNL: [Maestro](https://github.com/LLNL/maestrowf) for workflow execution, [Flux](http://flux-framework.org/) for workload management and scheduling, [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) for message brokering (orchestrated by Kubernetes), ConveyorLC for docking automation tasks, Fusion machine learning algorithms for binding affinity predictions, and GMD (Generative Molecular Design) for the small-molecule discovery loop.
