title: "Second Annual Developer Day Continues to Build on Success"
---

On August 15, LLNL hosted [Developer Day](https://computation.llnl.gov/newsroom/second-annual-developer-day-continues-build-success). The all-day event featured discussion panels, lightning talks, and deep dives intended to bring the LLNL developer community together. Many presentations featured open-source projects, both those developed at the Lab and those developed externally with the help of Lab contributions.
