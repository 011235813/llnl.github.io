title: LibRom: POD-Based Reduced Order Modeling
---

LibRom is a library designed to facilitate Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based Reduced Order Modeling (ROM). A key feature is an adaptive sampling algorithm that controls out of sub-space error with a minimum number of snapshots, which produces accurate ROMs of minimum dimension which may be generated and evaluated in correspondingly less time.
