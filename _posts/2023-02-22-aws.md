title: "AWS Leverages LLNL Finite Element Discretization for Electromagnetics Simulations of Quantum Computing Hardware"
categories: story
---

Amazon Web Services (AWS) recently introduced [Palace](https://github.com/awslabs/palace) (PArallel, LArge-scale Computational Electromagnetics), a parallel finite element code for full-wave electromagnetics simulations. Palace is used at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing to perform large-scale 3D simulations of complex electromagnetics models and enable the design of quantum computing hardware. This open source, parallel finite element code for full-wave 3D electromagnetic simulations in the frequency or time domain uses the [MFEM](http://mfem.org) finite element discretization library and can be installed via [Spack](https://spack.io). Learn more about Palace in [AWS's blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/aws-releases-open-source-software-palace-for-cloud-based-electromagnetics-simulations-of-quantum-computing-hardware/).
