[graphite](https://github.com/LLNL/graphite) is a repository for implementing graph network models based on atomic structures. It is meant to be a general toolbox of graph model codes (e.g., helper functions, custom graph convolutions, template graph models) for atomic structures. The repository contains examples and links to implemented and replicated works.
