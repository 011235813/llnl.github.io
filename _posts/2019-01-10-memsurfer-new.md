title: "New Repo: MemSurfer"

MemSurfer computes bilayer membrane surfaces found in a wide variety of large-scale molecular simulations. The tool works independent of the type of simulation, directly on the 3D point coordinates; as a result, it can handle a variety of membranes as well as atomic simulations.

Core functionality is written in Python and C++. Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LLNL/MemSurfer) for information about v0.1.
