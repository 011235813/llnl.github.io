GEOSX and its predecessor, GEOS, were developed from the ground up with the help of experts from across LLNL, combining a range of disciplines including engineering, seismology, hydrology, computational geoscience, and oil- and gas-industry expertise to build a tool that can take advantage of advanced computing platforms. A Research Highlight article in the latest issue of *Science & Technology Review* describes how GEOSX will improve the management and security of geological repositories and support planning for the widespread implementation of CO<sub>2</sub> storage at an industrial scale by simulating how fluids flow and rocks break deep underground.
