*When it comes to open source, dispelling myths and crystallizing reality are essential. Too often, the conversation focuses on open source as a competitor to proprietary code versus a complementary tool to existing investments. In fact, you may be surprised to discover some of the leading for-profit companies that are using, sponsoring, and contributing to open source projects. At the end of the day, open source is less about Control and more about Community.*
