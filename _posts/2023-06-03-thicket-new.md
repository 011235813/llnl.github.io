[Thicket](https://github.com/LLNL/thicket) is a Python-based toolkit for exploratory data analysis (EDA) of parallel performance data that enables performance optimization and understanding of applicationsâ€™ performance on supercomputers. It bridges the performance tool gap between being able to consider only a single instance of a simulation run (e.g., single platform, single measurement tool, or single scale) and finding actionable insights in multi-dimensional, multi-scale, multi-architecture, and multi-tool performance datasets. The repo includes [ReadTheDocs documentation](https://thicket.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
