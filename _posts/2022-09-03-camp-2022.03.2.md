[CAMP](https://github.com/LLNL/camp) collects a variety of macros and metaprogramming facilities for C++ projects. This release catches CAMP up to the version nomenclature for the [RAJA Portability Suite](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA), which has changed format to indicate year, month, and patch number. New features include support for CTAD and structured bindings as well as fixes for exported target issues.
