The Advanced Technology Development and Mitigation (ATDM) program within the Exascale Computing Project ([ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/)) shows that the best way to support the mission is through open collaboration and a sustainable software infrastructure. Although ATDM primarily supports NNSA’s traditionally closed mission of national security, LLNL’s ATDM Software Technology (ST) project contributes key open source components of a full-featured, integrated, and maintainable software stack for exascale systems that will impact both the ECP and the broader HPC community. A [new article](https://www.exascaleproject.org/highlight/llnl-atdm-addresses-software-infrastructure-needs-for-the-hpc-nnsa-cloud-and-exascale-communities/) on the ECP website describes the project's goals and technical focus areas in an interview with Livermore Computing division leader Becky Springmeyer and ATDM ST deputy lead Todd Gamblin.
