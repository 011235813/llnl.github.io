[ExaCA](https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA) is a cellular automata (CA) code for grain growth under additive manufacturing conditions by ExaAM within the Exascale Computing Project. ExaCA runs with the default enabled Kokkos backend and has been tested with Serial, OpenMP, Pthreads, CUDA, and HIP backends. The first major release includes simulations of directional solidification, grain structure output and analysis routines, and more. Installation instructions are in the [ExaCA README](https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA/blob/master/README.md).
