LLNL hosts hundreds of student interns annually—even during a year distinguished by the COVID-19 pandemic. This summer, the [Computing Scholar Program](https://computing.llnl.gov/careers/internships) welcomed 160 undergraduate and graduate students into virtual internships. The Lab’s open source community was already primed for student participation. A Computing [news article](https://computing.llnl.gov/newsroom/open-source-software-community-welcomes-virtual-internships) describes three open source projects that benefitted from interns' help: Ascent(https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent), MFEM(https://mfem.org), and this website. Mentors discuss the challenges of mentoring remotely, while students describe their experiences including skill development.
