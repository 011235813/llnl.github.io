LLNL's Computing directorate has released a five-part news series going behind the scenes of preparations for El Capitan. Topics include HPC facility upgrades, computing hardware  and software integrations, the Tri-Lab operating system, I/O, storage, and scheduling with [Flux](http://flux-framework.org/).

- [Road to El Capitan 1: It takes a village](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/road-el-capitan-1) – Livermore Computing is making significant progress toward siting the NNSA’s first exascale supercomputer.
- [Road to El Capitan 2: All the moving parts](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/road-el-capitan-2) – Siting a supercomputer requires close coordination of hardware, software, applications, and Livermore Computing facilities.
- [Road to El Capitan 3: The right operating system](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/road-el-capitan-3) – The Tri-Lab Operating System Stack (TOSS) ensures other national labs’ supercomputing needs are met.
- [Road to El Capitan 4: Storage in the exascale era](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/road-el-capitan-4) – Innovative hardware provides near-node local storage alongside large-capacity storage.
- [Road to El Capitan 5: A framework for complex workflows](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/road-el-capitan-5) – Flux, next-generation resource and job management software, steps up to support emerging use cases.
