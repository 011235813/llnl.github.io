[PDBspheres](https://github.com/LLNL/PDBspheres) is a structure-based method for finding and evaluating structural similarities in protein regions relevant to ligand binding. PDBspheres comprises an exhaustive library of protein structure regions (“spheres”) adjacent to complexed ligands derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), along with methods to find and evaluate structural matches between a protein of interest and spheres in the library.
