title: "RAJA: Managing Application Portability for Next-Generation Platforms"
---

RAJA is a software abstraction that systematically encapsulates platform-specific code to enable applications to be portable across diverse hardware architectures without major source code disruption. RAJA is designed to integrate with existing codes and provide a development model for new codes to be portable from inception.
