[HiOp](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop) is an optimization solver for solving certain mathematical optimization problems expressed as nonlinear programming problems. This lightweight HPC solver leverages application's existing data parallelism to parallelize the optimization iterations by using specialized linear algebra kernels. This version includes a Fortran interface and examples, implementation of CUDA CSR matrices, and improved robustness and performance of the mixed dense-sparse solver.
