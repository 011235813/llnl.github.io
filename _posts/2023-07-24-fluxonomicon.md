[Flux](http://flux-framework.org/) is a flexible framework for resource management consisting of a suite of projects, tools, and libraries which may be used to build site-custom resource managers for HPC centers. The project's [robust documentation](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) now includes a comic called *The Fluxonomicon*, which explains how Flux works in a fun new format, perfect for users who don't want to read a wall of text or who learn better through more visual means. Check out the first installment, [Chapter 1 - Why Is Flux](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comics/fluxonomicon.html#chapter-1-why-is-flux).
