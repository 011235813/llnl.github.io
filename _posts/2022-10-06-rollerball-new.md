The [Rollerball Notepad++ Plugin](https://github.com/LLNL/rollerball) repo contains code for a benignware (pseudo malware) plugin for the [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) editor based on this plugin template. The plugin purports to be an AutoSave feature, but in fact it exfiltrates file content based on keywords to a webserver that you specify. This code was designed as a way to test detection capabilities.
