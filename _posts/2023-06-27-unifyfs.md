A research team from Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore national labs [won the first IPDPS Best Open-Source Contribution Award](https://www.ornl.gov/news/unifyfs-team-wins-ipdps-award-open-source-software) for the paper “UnifyFS: A User-level Shared File System for Unified Access to Distributed Local Storage.” The paper presents UnifyFS, the product of a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional software development project that began in 2017. [UnifyFS](https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS) is a client-level file system that creates a shared namespace for distributed storage resources to allow an application to read and write to node-local storage the same way it would with a parallel file system.
