Developed as part of the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations ([CEED](https://github.com/CEED)) within the U.S. Department of Energy, [libCEED](https://github.com/CEED/libCEED) is a high-order API library that provides a common algebraic low-level operator description, allowing a wide variety of applications to take advantage of the efficient operator evaluation algorithms in the different CEED packages. This release includes improved support for *H*(div) bases, a new compressible Navier-Stokes mini-app, improvements to the interface, and more.
