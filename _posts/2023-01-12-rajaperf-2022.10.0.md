The RAJA performance suite ([RAJAPerf](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf)) is designed to explore performance of loop-based computational kernels found in HPC applications. It is used to assess, monitor, and compare runtime performance of kernels implemented using RAJA and variants implemented using standard or vendor-supported parallel programming models directly. This release has a new naming convention as per coordinated releases of RAJA Portability Suite projects. New features include CONVECTION3DPA finite element kernel, basic memory operation kernels MEMSET and MEMCPY, improved CI testing, and more.
