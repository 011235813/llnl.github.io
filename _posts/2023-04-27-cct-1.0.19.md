The [Coda Calibration Tool (CCT)](https://github.com/LLNL/coda-calibration-tool) calculates reliable moment magnitudes for small- to moderate-sized seismic events. This release provides an alpha version of the new Coda Envelope Ratio Tool (CERT), which allows users to measure amplitudes for loaded envelopes, generate ratios between events, and then attempt to invert the selected events for source parameters.
