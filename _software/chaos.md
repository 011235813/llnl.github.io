    The Clustered High Availability Operating System is the operating system
    software environment used on Livermore Computing (LC) Linux clusters. LC
    clusters range in size from small, single-rack capacity systems to
    capability systems, and all share a common cluster architecture, use
    similar hardware components where possible, and are managed by a close-knit
    group of system administrators.
